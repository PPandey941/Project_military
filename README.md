**Introduction**:
It is a single player, Third Person Style game created using a fusion of pure game development using 
Unity with A* algorithm, prim’s algorithm and recursive depth first search algorithm, specifically used for navigation 
and path finding. The characters have been created using Blender and the environment has been assembled in Unity.
The game is coded in C# (C sharp). C# is a hybrid of the languages C and Java.
The game also comprises of a maze created using algorithms through a process called procedural generation. 
In computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3D models.

**Game Creation**: Our environment and characters will be modelled using Blender, and then assembled using algorithms 
in Unity. The player will be spawned to the game; he will have functions like walking, running, crouching, etc. which 
will be added using Unity and animations. 
The player will be provided with a weapon; he will walk around the environment destroying his enemies and completing 
the list of objectives displayed. As the players levels will increase, so will the complexity of the game. We will use 
various algorithms to program the enemies AI for path finding, detecting, shooting and chasing the player.
We will add sound for more immersive experience, like shooting and walking. A storyline is being planned to be 
incorporated within the game. Both the enemies and the player will have a health bar each.
Objective of the game: Our game aims to tell a compelling a story and help players become immersed within the game 
space.
The algorithms will be able to provide a holistic approach that will enhance the player experience and increase the 
levels’ complexity as the player progresses in the game.
Our User Experience (UX) enhances the player’s experience of enjoyment and entertainment while playing our game
while our User Interface (UI) helps the player navigate, find information and accomplish missions. The UI components 
of our game are health bar, drones, guns, warehouse, etc.
